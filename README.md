# RetailShelfInventoryMonitoring
Retail self-inventory monitoring refers to the process by which retail businesses independently track and manage their inventory using in-house tools, systems, and staffâ€”without relying entirely on third-party inventory services or full manual audits.
 Key Characteristics:
                Self-managed: Handled internally by store employees or management.
                Technology-enabled: Often uses inventory management software, barcode scanners, RFID, or mobile apps.
                Real-time or periodic: Inventory can be updated live or through scheduled counts (like daily, weekly, or monthly cycle counts).
